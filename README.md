<h4><b>#Modules</b></h4>
<p>In Python, a module is a file containing Python code written by someone else. We can import these modules into our system and use them.</p>

<h4><b>#Pip</b></h4>
<p>Pip is a package manager for Python, which helps us to install various third-party modules in our system.</p>

<button>Example:</button>
```
Pip install flask
```
<h4><b>#Types of modules</b></h4>
<p>There are two types of modules in Python: built-in modules and external modules.</p>

<ul>
<li>Built-in modules -> Pre installed modules of python (Os, abc etc.)</li>
<li>External modules -> Third party modules (flask, pyJokes, tensorflow etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>#Comments</b></h4>
<p>In programming, comments are used to annotate code with explanations or to temporarily disable certain lines of code from being executed. In Python, we use # for single-line comments and ''' or """ for multi-line comments.</p>

<button>Examples:</button>
```
#this is a single line comment
#this is a single line comment

"""
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
"""
```
