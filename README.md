<h2>Chapter One</h2>
<h4><b>#Modules</b></h4>
<p>In Python, a module is a file containing Python code written by someone else. We can import these modules into our system and use them.</p>

<h4><b>#pip</b></h4>
<p>pip is a package manager for Python, which helps us to install various third-party modules in our system.</p>

<button style="background: yellow; border:none;">Example:</button>
```
pip install flask
```
<h4><b>#Types of modules</b></h4>
<p>There are two types of modules in Python: built-in modules and external modules.</p>

<ul>
<li>Built-in modules -> Pre installed modules of python (Os, abc etc.)</li>
<li>External modules -> Third party modules (flask, pyJokes, tensorflow etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>#Comments</b></h4>
<p>In programming, comments are used to annotate code with explanations or to temporarily disable certain lines of code from being executed. In Python, we use # for single-line comments and ''' or """ for multi-line comments.</p>

<button style="background: yellow; border:none;">Examples:</button>
```
#this is a single line comment
#this is a single line comment

"""
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
"""
```
<i>Chapter one practice/source code are added on the Chapter_one folder</i>

<h2>Chapter Two</h2>
<h4><b>#Variables</b></h4>
<p>Variables are containers in which we can store various types of data. They represent named memory locations in our program</p>

<button style="background: yellow; border:none;">Examples:</button>
```
a = "dinar"
b = 12
c = 32.3
```

<h4><b>#Data types</b></h4>
<p>Primarily there are following data types in python</p>

<ol>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Integers</li>
<li>Floating point numbers</li>
<li>Boolean</li>
<li>None</li>
</ol>

<p>Python automatically identifies the data types for us</p>

```
a = "dinar"    #Identifies a as class <str>
b = 12         #Identifies b as class <int>
c = 32.3       #Identifies c as class <float>
```

<h4><b>#Rules for defining a variable</b></h4>

<ol>
<li>A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores</li>
<li>Variable name can only be start with alphabets and underscores</li>
<li>Variable name can't have white spaces</li>
<li>Variable name can't be start with digits</li>
</ol>

<button style="background: yellow; border:none;">Examples:</button>

```
name = "dinar"    
num1 = 12         
_num2 = 32.3   
userName = "Mojahidul"     # camel case alternative to white spaces  
```

<h4><b>#Operators in python</b></h4>
<p>Following are some of the common operators in python.</p>

<ol>
<li>Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % etc.</li>
<li>Assignment operators: =, +=, -= etc.</li>
<li>Comparison operators: >, =>, <,<=, ==, != etc.</li>
<li>Logical operators: and, or, not</li>
</ol>
